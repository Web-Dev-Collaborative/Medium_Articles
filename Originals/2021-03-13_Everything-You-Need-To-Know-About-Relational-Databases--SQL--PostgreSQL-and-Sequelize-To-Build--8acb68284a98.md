### **Everything You Need To Know About Relational Databases, SQL, PostgreSQL and Sequelize To Build Your Backend!** {#bb85 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="bb85"}

**For Front end developers who like myself struggle with making the jump
to fullstack.**

You can access and query the data using the findByPk, findOne, and
findAll methods.

**Terminology:**

-   [[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor} We re going to use this to run JavaScript code
    on the server. I ve decided to use the latest version of Node,
    v6.3.0 at the time of writing, so that we ll have access to most of
    the new features introduced in ES6.]{#c63a}
-   [[Express](https://expressjs.com/){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor} As per their website, Express is a Fast,
    unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js , that we re
    going to be building our Todo list application on.]{#11a6}
-   [[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/index.html){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor} This is a powerful open-source database that we
    re going to use. I ve attached an article I published on the setup
    below!]{#5808}

[**PostgreSQL Setup For Windows & WSL/Ubuntu**\
*If you follow this guide to a tee you will install PostgreSQL itself on
your Windows installation. Then, you will*
bryanguner.medium.com](https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089 "https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089") 

-   [However, if you face issues while installing PostgreSQL, or you don
    t want to dive into installing it, you can opt for a version of
    PostgreSQL hosted online. I recommend
    [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor}. I found it s pretty easy to get started with.
    However, the free version will only give you a 20MB
    allowance.]{#bb49}
-   [[Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor} In addition, we re going to use Sequelize, which
    is a database
    [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor} that will interface with the Postgres database
    for us.]{#539a}

**RDBMS and Database Entities**

**Define what a relational database management system is**

-   [RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System]{#6529}
-   [A software application that you run that your programs can connect
    to so that they can store, modify, and retrieve data.]{#6d7e}
-   [An RDBMS can track many databases. We will use PostgreSQL, or
    postgres , primarily for our RDBMS and it will be able to create
    individual databases for each of our projects.]{#79d9}

**Describe what relational data is**

-   [In general, relational data is information that is connected to
    other pieces of information.]{#d8fd}
-   [When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries
    together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).]{#2fa8}
-   [In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as
    well as the toys that each of them own. That ownership of a cat to a
    toy is the relational aspect of relational data. Two pieces of
    information that can be connected together to show some sort of
    meaning.]{#e199}

**Define what a database is**

-   [The actual location that data is stored.]{#06fe}
-   [A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific
    kinds of information.]{#78c5}
-   [We could have a pets database that stores information about many
    different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be
    represented by a different table.]{#f752}

**Define what a database table is**

-   [Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of
    information.]{#04ae}
-   [The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records
    on other tables through the use of foreign keys]{#3878}
-   [In our pets database, we could have a dogs table, with individual
    records]{#d6f9}

**Describe the purpose of a primary key**

-   [A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for
    the table.]{#4d0e}
-   [We often use an id field that simply increments with each entry.
    The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier,
    even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two
    people with the same name would still need to have a unique
    identifier, for example).]{#8fb0}
-   [With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the
    table to records from other tables.]{#8876}

**Describe the purpose of a foreign key**

-   [A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the
    primary key of another table s record.]{#cf54}
-   [In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a
    table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these
    tables has a primary key of id that is used as the unique
    identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat,
    we can add another field to the cat table called owner\_id ,
    indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a
    toy s owner\_id to the same value as a particular cat s id , we can
    indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.]{#f397}

**Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL**

-   [Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase
    letters, numbers, and underscores.]{#d6e6}
-   [Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for
    cats would typically be cats and office locations would be
    office\_locations (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces,
    plural)]{#0fb3}

**Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql**

-   [The psql command by default will try to connect to a database and
    username that matches your system s username]{#1b7f}
-   [We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the
    psql command]{#1454}
-   [psql pets]{#3439}
-   [To connect with a different username we can use the -U flag
    followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the
    pets database as pets\_user]{#fb37}
-   [psql -U pets\_user pets]{#d357}
-   [If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would
    like a prompt for the password to show up by using the -W
    flag.]{#e139}
-   [psql -U pets\_user -W pets (the order of our flags doesn t matter,
    as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as
    pets\_user directly following -U in this example)]{#8709}

**Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt
in the psql shell**

-   [You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by
    the prompt in the terminal.]{#8ff5}
-   [If the prompt shows =\>, the user is a normal user]{#de97}
-   [If the prompt show =\#, the user is a superuser]{#7ce3}

**Create a user for the relational database management system**

-   [Within psql, we can create a user with the CREATE USER {username}
    {WITH options} command.]{#f4dc}
-   [The most common options we ll want to use are WITH PASSWORD
    'mypassword' to provide a password for the user we are creating,
    CREATEDB to allow the user to create new databases, or SUPERUSER to
    create a user with all elevated permissions.]{#7eda}

**Create a database in the database management system**

-   [We can use the command CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options}
    inside psql to create a new database.]{#3fff}
-   [A popular option we may utilize is WITH OWNER {owner name} to set
    another user as the owner of the database we are making.]{#7d2f}

**Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can
connect to it**

-   [We can GRANT and REVOKE privileges from a database to users or
    categories of users.]{#1a73}
-   [In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the
    public we can use REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db\_name} FROM
    PUBLIC;, removing all public connection access.]{#8795}
-   [If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could
    similarly do GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db\_name} FROM {specific
    user, PUBLIC, etc.};]{#ee98}

**View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL**

-   [To list all databases we can use the \\l or \\list command in
    psql.]{#2111}

**Create tables in a database**

```
 {#7f71 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="7f71"}
CREATE TABLE {table name} (
{columnA} {typeA},
{columnB} {typeB},
etc…
);
```


-   [The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on
    multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can
    be presented differently.]{#a2fc}
-   [One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the
    last column cannot have a comma after its type in this
    example.]{#a203}

**View a list of tables in a database**

-   [To list all database tables, use the \\dt command.]{#964a}

**Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL**

-   [There are many different data types that we can use in our tables,
    here are some common examples:]{#a2fd}
-   [SERIAL: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs]{#1d53}
-   [VARCHAR(n): a string with a character limit of n]{#78ce}
-   [TEXT: doesn t have character limit, but less performant]{#2e02}
-   [BOOLEAN: true/false]{#c20e}
-   [SMALLINT: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)]{#d525}
-   [INTEGER: signed four-byte integer (standard)]{#6b96}
-   [BIGINT: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)]{#fa38}
-   [NUMERIC: or DECIMAL, can store exact decimal values]{#aa0c}
-   [TIMESTAMP: date and time]{#1fb6}

**Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and
create columns in database tables that have them**

-   [In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints
    to place on our column data.]{#377b}
-   [The UNIQUE flag indicates that the data for the column must not be
    repeated.]{#bda2}
-   [By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing
    data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don t provide an
    age because we don t know it, for example. If we want to require
    that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can
    indicate that column must be NOT NULL.]{#e14c}
-   [In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique
    names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have
    no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages
    or their complete absence.]{#6745}

```
 {#598c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="598c"}
CREATE TABLE pets (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
age SMALLINT
);
```


**Create a primary key for a table**

-   [When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in
    the column name to parentheses like so:]{#da50}

```
 {#408c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="408c"}
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50),
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```


-   [We could have also used the PRIMARY KEY flag on the column
    definition itself:]{#4871}

```
 {#522c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="522c"}
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```


**Create foreign key constraints to relate tables**

-   [In our table definition, we can use the line FOREIGN KEY
    (foreign\_key\_stored\_in\_this\_table) REFERENCE {other table}
    ({other\_tables\_key\_name}) to connect two tables.]{#e576}
-   [This is probably easier to see in an example:]{#4c08}

```
 {#5089 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="5089"}
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);
```


```
 {#deb9 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="deb9"}
CREATE TABLE pets (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255),
age SMALLINT,
person_id INTEGER,
FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id)
);
```


**SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity
names**

-   [Exactly as the LO states, CREATE TABLE and create table are
    interpreted the same way. Using capitalization is a good convention
    in order to distinguish your keywords.]{#7749}
-   [The entity names that we use ARE case-sensitive, however. So a
    table named pets is unique from a table named Pets. In general, we
    prefer to use all lowercase for our entities to avoid any of this
    confusion.]{#7d1b}

**SQL**

1\. How to use the SELECT ... FROM ... statement to select data from a
single table

-   [Supply the column names in the SELECT clause. If we want all
    columns, we can also use \*]{#9202}
-   [Supply the table names in the FROM clause]{#9fdc}

--- Selects all columns from the friends table

```
 {#178f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="178f"}
SELECT
*
FROM
friends;
```


--- Selects the first\_name column from the friends table (remember
whitespace is ignored)\
SELECT name\
FROM friends;

-   [Sometimes we may need to specify what table we are selecting a
    column from, particulurly if we had joined multiple tables
    together.]{#ef22}

--- Notice here we are indicating that we want the "name" field from the
"friends" table as well as the "name" field from the "puppies" table. We
indicate the table name by table.column\
 --- We are also aliasing these fields with the AS keyword so that our
returned results have friend\_name and puppy\_name as field headers

```
 {#774f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="774f"}
SELECT
friends.name AS friend_name , puppies.name AS puppy_name
FROM
friends
JOIN
puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id
```


**How to use the WHERE clause on SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
to narrow the scope of the command**

-   [The WHERE clause allows us to select or apply actions to records
    that match specific criteria instead of to a whole table.]{#6a59}
-   [We can use WHERE with a couple of different operators when making
    our comparison]{#7ec8}
-   [WHERE {column} = {value} provides an exact comparison]{#70eb}
-   [WHERE {column} IN ({value1}, {value2}, {value3}, etc.) matches any
    provided value in the IN statement. We can make this more complex by
    having a subquery inside of the parentheses, having our column match
    any values within the returned results.]{#79bf}
-   [WHERE {column} BETWEEN {value1} AND {value2} can check for matches
    between two values (numeric ranges)]{#150e}
-   [WHERE {column} LIKE {pattern} can check for matches to a string.
    This is most useful when we use the wildcard %, such as WHERE breed
    LIKE '%Shepherd', which will match any breed that ends in
    Shepherd]{#9077}
-   [The NOT operator can also be used for negation in the
    checks.]{#4a87}
-   [Mathematical operators can be used when performing calculations or
    comparisons within a query as well, such as]{#db35}

```
 {#b6c2 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="b6c2"}
SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 50; — OR SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 5;
```


**How to use the JOIN keyword to join two (or more) tables together into
a single virtual table**

-   [When we want to get information from a related table or do querying
    based on related table values, we can join the connected table by
    comparing the foreign key to where it lines up on the other
    table:]{#a391}

--- Here we are joining the puppies table on to the friends table. We
are specifying that the comparison we should make is the foreign key
puppy\_id on the friends table should line up with the primary key id on
the puppies table.

```
 {#c2da .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="c2da"}
SELECT
*
FROM
friends
JOIN
puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id
```


**How to use the INSERT statement to insert data into a table**

-   [When a table is already created we can then insert records into it
    using the INSERT INTO keywords.]{#b3e7}
-   [We provide the name of the table that we would like to add records
    to, followed by the VALUES keyword and each record we are adding.
    Here s an example:]{#d4d3}

--- We are providing the table name, then multiple records to insert\
 --- The values are listed in the order that they are defined on the
table

```
 {#f963 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="f963"}
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);
```


-   [We can also specify columns when we are inserting data. This makes
    it clear which fields we are providing data for and allows us to
    provide them out of order, skip null or default values, etc.]{#123c}

--- In this example, we want to use the default value for id since it is
autoincremented, so we provide DEFAULT for this field

```
 {#db9b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="db9b"}
INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(DEFAULT, ‘Amy’, ‘Pond’);
```


--- Alternatively, we can leave it out completely, since the default
value will be used if none is provided

```
 {#a343 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="a343"}
INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(‘Rose’, ‘Tyler’),
(‘Martha’, ‘Jones’),
(‘Donna’, ‘Noble’),
(‘River’, ‘Song’);
```


**How to use an UPDATE statement to update data in a table**

-   [The UPDATE keyword can be used to find records and change their
    values in our database.]{#8e80}
-   [We generally follow the pattern of UPDATE {table} SET {column} =
    {new value} WHERE {match condition};.]{#91b5}
-   [Without a condition to narrow our records down, we will update
    every record in the table, so this is an important thing to double
    check!]{#5fff}
-   [We can update multiple fields as well by specifying each column in
    parentheses and their associated new values: UPDATE {table} SET
    ({column1}, {column2}) = ({value1}, {value2}) WHERE {match
    condition};]{#cdee}

--- Updates the pet with id of 4 to change their name and breed

```
 {#2a61 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="2a61"}
UPDATE
pets
SET
(name, breed) = (‘Floofy’, ‘Fluffy Dog Breed’) WHERE id = 4;
```


**How to use a DELETE statement to remove data from a table**

-   [Similar to selecting records, we can delete records from a table by
    specifying what table we are deleting from and what criteria we
    would like to match in order to delete.]{#1c5e}
-   [We follow the general structure DELETE FROM {table} WHERE
    {condition};]{#1b25}
-   [The condition here is also very important! Without a condition, all
    records match and will be deleted.]{#0e74}

--- Deletes from the pets table any record that either has a name
Floofy, a name Doggo, or an id of 3.

```
 {#bd4b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="bd4b"}
DELETE FROM
pets
WHERE
name IN (‘Floofy’, ‘Doggo’) OR id = 3;
```


**How to use a seed file to populate data in a database**

-   [Seed files are a great way for us to create records that we want to
    start our database out with.]{#687c}
-   [Instead of having to individually add records to our tables or
    manually entering them in psql or postbird, we can create a file
    that has all of these records and then just pass this file to psql
    to run.]{#80f6}
-   [Seed files are also great if we ever need to reset our database. We
    can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our
    tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined
    starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing
    environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.]{#28da}
-   [There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the \<
    and the \| operators. They perform the same function for us, just in
    slightly different orders, taking the content of a .sql file and
    executing in within the psql environment:]{#22c5}
-   [psql -d {database} \< {sql filepath}]{#19c8}
-   [cat {sql filepath} \| psql -d {database}]{#7ec0}

**SQL (continued)**

**How to perform relational database design**

-   [Steps to Designing the Database:]{#8204}
-   [Define the entities. What data are are you storing, what are the
    fields for each entity?]{#0276}
-   [You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented
    programming).]{#cd73}
-   [If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes
    would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are
    created in your database.]{#0cf7}
-   [The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the
    fields/columns that we need for each table.]{#57f4}
-   [Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you
    can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to
    the database.]{#0681}
-   [Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with
    foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one,
    one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.]{#99da}
-   [With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a
    foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that
    it is connected to.]{#c8c4}
-   [With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to
    multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these
    entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one
    table to a record from another table.]{#2e56}

**How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one
succeed or fail operation**

-   [We can define an explicit transaction using BEGIN and ending with
    either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.]{#6bfa}
-   [If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled
    back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of
    the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when
    analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.]{#0c34}

```
 {#de92 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="de92"}
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance — 100.00
WHERE name = ‘Alice’;
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance — 100.00
WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Alice’);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
WHERE name = ‘Bob’;
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Bob’);
COMMIT;
```


```
 {#d801 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="d801"}
BEGIN;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
UPDATE cities
SET city = ‘New York City’
WHERE city = ‘New York’;
ROLLBACK;
```


**How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance**

-   [An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly.
    If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular
    field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in
    order to speed up this process.]{#704c}
-   [An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference
    to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If
    we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for,
    we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than
    having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since
    the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).]{#142a}
-   [To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:]{#2c8f}

```
 {#0d60 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="0d60"}
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```


-   [To drop an index we can do the following:]{#a6d3}

```
 {#f3ce .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="f3ce"}
DROP INDEX index_name
```


-   [Making an index is not always the best approach. Indices allow for
    faster lookup, but slow down record insertion and the updating of
    associated fields, since we not only have to add the information to
    the table, but also manipulate the index.]{#12fa}
-   [We generally wouldn t care about adding an index if:]{#0ef6}
-   [The tables are small]{#8833}
-   [We are updating the table frequently, especially the associated
    columns]{#b3b0}
-   [The column has many NULL values]{#5ebd}

**Explain what the EXPLAIN command is used for:**

-   [EXPLAIN gives us information about how a query will run (the query
    plan)]{#36da}
-   [It gives us an idea of how our database will search for data as
    well as a qualitative comparitor for how expensive that operation
    will be. Comparing the cost of two queries will tell us which one is
    more efficient (lower cost).]{#482c}
-   [We can also use the ANALYZE command with EXPLAIN, which will
    actually run the specified query. Doing so gives us more detailed
    information, such as the milliseconds it took our query to execute
    as well as specifics like the exact number of rows filtered and

Pool class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database

-   [We can add the node-postgres library to our application with npm
    install pg. From there we will typically use the Pool class
    associated with this library. That way we can run many SQL queries
    with one database connection (as opposed to Client, which closes the
    connection after a query).]{#8f73}

```
 {#a04e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="a04e"}
const { Pool } = require(‘pg’);
```


// If we need to specify a username, password, or database, we can do so
when we create a Pool instance, otherwise the default values for logging
in to psql are used:

```
 {#2cb8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="2cb8"}
const pool = new Pool({ username: ‘<<username>>’, password: ‘<<password>>’, database: ‘<<database>>’})
```


-   [The query method on the Pool instance will allow us to execute a
    SQL query on our database. We can pass in a string that represents
    the query we want to run]{#a267}

```
 {#64af .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="64af"}
const allAirportsSql = `
SELECT id, city_id, faa_id, name
FROM airports;
`;
```


```
 {#5b49 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="5b49"}
async function selectAllAirports() {
const results = await pool.query(allAirportsSql);
console.log(results.rows);
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database
}
```


selectAllAirports();

-   [The return value of this asynchronous function is an object with a
    rows key that points to an array of objects, each object
    representing a record with field names as keys.]{#edf8}

**Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for
parameters of the form \$1 , \$2 , and so on**

-   [The prepared statement (SQL string that we wrote) can also be made
    more dynamic by allowing for parameters to be passed in.]{#ee72}
-   [The Pool instance s query function allows us to pass a second
    argument, an array of parameters to be used in the query string. The
    location of the parameter substitutions are designated with \$1,
    \$2, etc., to signify the first, second, etc., arguments.]{#3b64}

```
 {#03f2 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="03f2"}
const airportsByNameSql = `
SELECT name, faa_id
FROM airports
WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER($1)
`;
```


async function selectAirportsByName(name) {\
const results = await pool.query(airportsByNameSql, \[ \`%\${name}%\`
\]);\
console.log(results.rows);\
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database\
}

```
 {#20be .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="20be"}
// Get the airport name from the command line and store it
// in the variable “name”. Pass that value to the
// selectAirportsByName function.
const name = process.argv[2];
// console.log(name);
selectAirportsByName(name);
```


**ORM**

1\. How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript

-   [To start a new project we use our standard npm initialize
    statement]{#0e86}
-   [npm init -y]{#7bf0}
-   [Add in the packages we will need (sequelize, sequelize-cli, and
    pg)]{#564b}
-   [npm install sequelize\@⁵.0.0 sequelize-cli\@⁵.0.0 pg\@⁸.0.0]{#9c9b}
-   [Initialize sequelize in our project]{#0b1c}
-   [npx sequelize-cli init]{#8052}
-   [Create a database user with credentials we will use for the
    project]{#d03e}
-   [psql]{#bbc8}
-   [CREATE USER example\_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword']{#caca}
-   [Here we can also create databases since we are already in
    postgres]{#72ab}

```
 {#4bb4 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="4bb4"}
CREATE DATABASE example_app_development WITH OWNER example_user
```


```
 {#9003 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="9003"}
CREATE DATABASE example_app_test WITH OWNER example_user
```


```
 {#756d .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="756d"}
CREATE DATABASE example_app_production WITH OWNER example_user
```


-   [If we don t create these databases now, we could also create them
    after we make our changes to our config file. If we take this
    approach, we need to make sure our user that we created has the
    CREATEDB option when we make them, since sequelize will attempt to
    make the databases with this user. This other approach would look
    like:]{#ae27}
-   [In psql: CREATE USER example\_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword'
    CREATEDB]{#f6a3}
-   [In terminal: npx sequelize-cli db:create]{#45ac}
-   [Double check that our configuration file matches our username,
    password, database, dialect, and seederStorage (these will be filled
    out for you in an assessment scenario):]{#cff2}

```
 {#3bab .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="3bab"}
{
“development”: {
“username”: “sequelize_recipe_box_app”,
“password”: “HfKfK79k”,
“database”: “recipe_box_development”,
“host”: “127.0.0.1”,

}
}
```


1\. How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your
application in a source-control enabled way

**Migrations**

-   [In order to make new database tables and sequelize models that
    reflect them, we want to generate a migration file and model file
    using model:generate]{#3710}

```
 {#7ce9 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="7ce9"}
npx sequelize-cli model:generate — name Cat — attributes “firstName:string,specialSkill:string”
```


-   [Here we are creating a migration file and a model file for a Cat.
    We are specifying that we want this table to have fields for
    firstName and specialSkill. Sequelize will automatically make fields
    for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to
    specify these.]{#bc91}
-   [Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any
    details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database
    constraints such as allowNull: false, adding a uniqueness constraint
    with unique: true, adding in character limits to fields such as
    type: Sequelize.STRING(100), or specifying a foreign key with
    references to another table references: { model: 'Categories'
    }.]{#4d04}
-   [After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need
    to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to
    actually create the table.]{#ca79}

```
 {#409e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="409e"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```


-   [This command runs any migration files that have not been previously
    run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp
    in the file name is important)]{#78a8}
-   [If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo
    our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing
    them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They
    won t be deleted from the undo, so we don t need to generate
    anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already
    exist and save the files.). Running the migrations again will make
    the tables with the updates reflected.]{#0790}

```
 {#1c17 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="1c17"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```


```
 {#76a3 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="76a3"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
```


**Models Validations and Associations**

-   [In addition to the migration files, our model:generate command also
    created a model file for us. This file is what allows sequelize to
    transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript
    objects for us.]{#a4dd}
-   [The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to
    perform before trying to run a SQL query. If the validation fails,
    we can respond with a message instead of running the query, which
    can be an expensive operation that we know won t work.]{#5c70}

```
 {#2c1f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="2c1f"}
// Before we make changes, sequelize generates the type that this field represents specification:
DataTypes.TEXT
// We can replace the generated format with an object to specify not only the type, but the validations that we want to implement. The validations can also take in messages the respond with on failure and arguments.
specification: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    validate: {
        notEmpty: {
            msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
        },
        len: {
            args: [10, 100]
            msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
        }
    }
}
```


-   [Another key part of the model file is setting up our associations.
    We can use the belongsTo, hasMany, and belongsToMany methods to set
    up model-level associations. Doing so is what creates the helpful
    functionality like addOwner that we saw in the pets example, a
    function that automatically generates the SQL necessary to create a
    petOwner record and supplies the appropriate petId and
    ownerId.]{#94ef}
-   [In a one-to-many association, we need to have a belongsTo
    association on the many side, and a hasMany association on the one
    side:]{#e5fc}
-   [Instruction.belongsTo(models.Recipe, { foreignKey: 'recipeId'
    });]{#21c2}
-   [Recipe.hasMany(models.Instruction, { foreignKey: 'recipeId'
    });]{#6e6b}
-   [In a many-to-many association, we need to have a belongsToMany on
    each side of the association. We generally specify a columnMapping
    object to show the association more clearly:]{#7d6a}

```
 {#7983 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="7983"}
// In our Owner model
```


```
 {#d349 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="d349"}

### **How to perform CRUD operations with Sequelize** {#5d1e .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="5d1e"}

-   [Seed Files]{#fc1a}
-   [Seed files can be used to populate our database with starter
    data.]{#ad49}
-   [npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --- name add-cats]{#9058}
-   [up indicates what to create when we seed our database, down
    indicates what to delete if we want to unseed the database.]{#d2cf}
-   [For our up, we use the queryInterface.bulkInsert() method, which
    takes in the name of the table to seed and an array of objects
    representing the records we want to create:]{#d605}

```
 {#2040 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="2040"}
up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkInsert('<<TableName>>', [{
        field1: value1a,
        field2: value2a
    }, {
        field1: value1b,
        field2: value2b
    }, {
        field1: value1c,
        field2: value2c
    }]);
}
```


-   [For our down, we use the queryInterface.bulkDelete() method, which
    takes in the name of the table and an object representing our WHERE
    clause. Unseeding will delete all records from the specified table
    that match the WHERE clause.]{#0cb9}

```
 {#d6ae .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="d6ae"}
// If we want to specify what to remove:
down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘<<TableName>>’, {
field1: [value1a, value1b, value1c], //…etc.
});
};
// If we want to remove everything from the table:
down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘<<TableName>>’, null, {});
};
```


-   [Running npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all will run all of our seeder
    files.]{#c9e3}
-   [npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all will undo all of our
    seeding.]{#8778}
-   [If we omit the :all we can run specific seed files]{#d655}
-   [Inserting with Build and Create]{#4788}
-   [In addition to seed files, which we generally use for starter data,
    we can create new records in our database by using build and save,
    or the combined create]{#fc2d}
-   [Use the .build method of the Cat model to create a new Cat instance
    in index.js]{#3807}

```
 {#648e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="648e"}
// Constructs an instance of the JavaScript `Cat` class. **Does not
// save anything to the database yet**. Attributes are passed in as a
// POJO.
const newCat = Cat.build({
    firstName: 'Markov',
    specialSkill: 'sleeping',
    age: 5
});
// This actually creates a new `Cats` record in the database. We must
// wait for this asynchronous operation to succeed.
await newCat.save();
// This builds and saves all in one step. If we don't need to perform any operations on the instance before saving it, this can optimize our code.
const newerCat = await Cat.create({
    firstName: 'Whiskers',
    specialSkill: 'sleeping',
    age: 2
})
```


**Updating Records**

-   [When we have a reference to an instance of a model (i.e. after we
    have queried for it or created it), we can update values by simply
    reassigning those fields and using the save method]{#4ecc}

**Deleting Records**

-   [When we have a reference to an instance of a model, we can delete
    that record by using destroy]{#606a}
-   [const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1); // Remove the Markov record.
    await cat.destroy();]{#be30}
-   [We can also call destroy on the model itself. By passing in an
    object that specifies a where clause, we can destroy all records
    that match that query]{#0b7f}
-   [await Cat.destroy({ where: { specialSkill: 'jumping' } });]{#5f9f}

**How to query using Sequelize**

**findAll**

```
 {#89ec .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="89ec"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll();
// Log the fetched cats.
// The extra arguments to stringify are a replacer and a space respectively
// Here we're specifying a space of 2 in order to print more legibly
// We don't want a replacer, so we pass null just so that we can pass a 3rd argument
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


**WHERE clause**

-   [Passing an object to findAll can add on clauses to our
    query]{#e68d}
-   [The where key takes an object as a value to indicate what we are
    filtering by]{#ec33}
-   [{ where: { field: value } } =\> WHERE field = value]{#aa61}

```
 {#c50b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="c50b"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: “Markov” } }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


**OR in the WHERE clause**

-   [Using an array for the value tells sequelize we want to match any
    of these values]{#755e}

{ where: { field: \[value1, value2\] } =\> WHERE field IN (value1,
value2)

```
 {#aa84 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="aa84"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: [“Markov”, “Curie”] } });const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        firstName: "Markov",
        age: 4
    }
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


```
 {#2363 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="2363"}
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


**AND in the WHERE clause**

-   [Providing additional key/value pairs to the where object indicates
    all filters must match]{#afbb}
-   [{ where: { field1: value1, field2: value2 } } =\> WHERE field1 =
    value1 AND field2 = value2]{#45a1}

### Sequelize Op operator {#9cb5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="9cb5"}

-   [By requiring Op from the sequelize library we can provide more
    advanced comparison operators]{#dd6a}
-   [const { Op } = require("sequelize");]{#0a01}
-   [Op.ne: Not equal operator]{#8936}

```
 {#0fdd .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="0fdd"}

            [Op.ne]: "Markov"
        },
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


### Op.and: and operator {#16ad .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="16ad"}

```
 {#9686 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="9686"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        // The array that Op.and points to must all be true 
        // Here, we find cats where the name is not "Markov" and the age is 4
        [Op.and]: [{
            firstName: {
                [Op.ne]: "Markov"
            }
        }, {
            age: 4
        }, ],
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


### Op.or: or operator {#66d6 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="66d6"}

```
 {#77d1 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="77d1"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        // One condition in the array that Op.or points to must be true 
        // Here, we find cats where the name is "Markov" or where the age is 4
        [Op.or]: [{
            firstName: "Markov"
        }, {
            age: 4
        }, ],
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


Op.gt and Op.lt: greater than and less than operators

const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { // Find all cats where the age
is greater than 4 age: { \[Op.gt\]: 4 }, } }, });
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

#### Ordering results {#d61a .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="d61a"}

-   [Just like the where clause, we can pass an order key to specify we
    want our results ordered]{#4ee4}
-   [The key order points to an array with the fields that we want to
    order by]{#46a6}
-   [By default, the order is ascending, just like standard SQL. If we
    want to specify descending, we can instead use a nested array with
    the field name as the first element and DESC as the second element.
    (We could also specify ASC as a second element in a nested array,
    but it is unnecessary as it is default)]{#ba7f}
-   [const cats = await Cat.findAll({ // Order by age descending, then
    by firstName ascending if cats have the same age order: \[\["age",
    "DESC"\], "firstName"\], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null,
    2));]{#f9f9}

```
 {#d42e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="d42e"}
// Get a reference to the cat record that we want to update (here just the cat with primary key of 1)
const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1);
// Change cat's attributes.
cat.firstName = "Curie";
cat.specialSkill = "jumping";
cat.age = 123;
// Save the new name to the database.
await cat.save();
```


-   [Limiting results]{#c46e}
-   [We can provide a limit key in order to limit our results to a
    specified number]{#8e6f}

```
 {#8273 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="8273"}
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    order: [
        ["age", "DESC"]
    ],
    // Here we are limiting our results to one record. It will still return an array, just with one object inside. We could have said any number here, the result is always an array. 
    limit: 1,
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
```


### findOne {#f60d .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="f60d"}

-   [If we only want one record to be returned we can use findOne
    instead of findAll]{#0151}
-   [If multiple records would have matched our findOne query, it will
    return the first record]{#2a32}
-   [Unlike findAll, findOne will return the object directly instead of
    an array. If no records matched the query it will return
    null.]{#4c25}

```
 {#f26a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="f26a"}
// finds the oldest cat const cat = await Cat.findOne({ order: [[“age”, “DESC”]], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cat, null, 2));
```


-   [**Querying with Associations**]{#3bc7}

We can include associated data by adding an include key to our options
object

```
 {#c81c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="c81c"}
const pet = Pet.findByPk(1, {
    include: [PetType, Owner]
});
console.log(pet.id, pet.name, pet.age, pet.petTypeId, pet.PetType.type, pet.Owners
```


We can get nested associations by having include point to an object that
specifies which model we have an association with, then chaining an
association on with another include

**How to perform data validations with Sequelize**

-   [See the database migrations section above.]{#e654}
-   [In general, we add in a validate key to each field that we want
    validations for. This key points to an object that specifies all of
    the validations we want to make on that field, such as notEmpty,
    notNull, len, isIn, etc.]{#9f26}

```
 {#cd37 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--li name="cd37"}
specification: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    validate: {
        notEmpty: {
            msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
        },
        len: {
            args: [10, 100]
            msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
        }
    }
}
```


**How to use transactions with Sequelize**

-   [We can create a transaction block in order to make sure either all
    operations are performed or none of them are]{#1059}
-   [We use the .transaction method in order to create our block. The
    method takes in a callback with an argument to track our transaction
    id (typically just a simple tx variable).]{#a632}
-   [All of our sequelize operations can be passed a transaction key on
    their options argument which points to our transaction id. This
    indicates that this operation is part of the transaction block and
    should only be executed in the database when the whole block
    executes without error.]{#79f9}

### Sequelize Cheatsheet {#0ad4 .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading name="0ad4"}
 
#### Command Line {#52ef .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="52ef"}

Sequelize provides utilities for generating migrations, models, and seed
files. They are exposed through the `sequelize-cli`  command.

#### Init Project {#7d79 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="7d79"}

```
 {#96e0 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="96e0"}
$ npx sequelize-cli init
```


You must create a database user, and update the
`config/config.json`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} file to match your
database settings to complete the initialization process.

#### Create Database {#133c .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="133c"}

```
 {#366a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="366a"}
npx sequelize-cli db:create
```


#### Generate a model and its migration {#d695 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="d695"}

```
 {#bd86 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="bd86"}
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name <ModelName> --attributes <column1>:<type>,<column2>:<type>,...
```


#### Run pending migrations {#d6c1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="d6c1"}

```
 {#955a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="955a"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```


#### Rollback one migration {#016b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="016b"}

```
 {#e851 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="e851"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```


#### Rollback all migrations {#d9e4 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="d9e4"}

```
 {#51b8 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="51b8"}
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
```


#### Generate a new seed file {#d44b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="d44b"}
 
```
 {#8b7a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="8b7a"}
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name <descriptiveName>
```


#### Run all pending seeds {#97d8 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="97d8"}
 
```
 {#b1ee .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="b1ee"}
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```


#### Rollback one seed {#3ea4 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="3ea4"}
 
```
 {#05d4 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h4 name="05d4"}

npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
```


#### Migrations {#fc2b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--pre name="fc2b"}

### Create Table (usually used in the up() method) {#f3b5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h4 name="f3b5"}
 
```
 {#ab1a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="ab1a"}
// This uses the short form for references
return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
    <columnName>: {

        unique: <true|false>,
        references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                            // that the column references.
    }
});
// This the longer form for references that is less confusing
return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
    <columnName>: {
        type: Sequelize.<type>,
        allowNull: <true|false>,
        unique: <true|false>,
        references: {
            model: {
                tableName: <TableName> // This is the plural table name
            }
        }
    }
});
```


### Delete Table (usually used in the down() function) {#9e63 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="9e63"}

```
 {#f040 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="f040"}
return queryInterface.dropTable(<TableName>);
```


### Adding a column {#b8c5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="b8c5"}
 
```
 {#e875 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="e875"}
return queryInteface.addColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>: {
    type: Sequelize.<type>,
    allowNull: <true|false>,
    unique: <true|false>,
    references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                        // that the column references.
});
```


### Removing a column {#edd5 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="edd5"}
 
```

```


### Model Associations {#cfca .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="cfca"}

### One to One between Student and Scholarship {#d10a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="d10a"}

`student.js`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}

```
 {#3155 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="3155"}
Student.hasOne(models.Scholarship, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

const columnMapping = {
    through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
    otherKey: 'lessonId',
    foreignKey: 'studentId'
}
Student.belongsToMany(models.Lesson, columnMapping);
```


`lesson.js`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}

```
 {#9827 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="9827"}
const columnMapping = {
    through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
    otherKey: 'studentId',
    foreignKey: 'lessonId'
}
Lesson.belongsToMany(models.Student, columnMapping);
```


### Inserting a new item {#c2cc .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="c2cc"}
 
```
 {#be36 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="be36"}
// Way 1 - With build and save
const pet = Pet.build({
    name: "Fido",
    petTypeId: 1
});
await pet.save();
// Way 2 - With create
const pet = await Pet.create({
    name: "Fido",
    petTypeId: 1
});
```


### Updating an item {#51bf .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="51bf"}
 
```
 {#a04a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="a04a"}
// Find the pet with id = 1
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
// Way 1
pet.name = "Fido, Sr."
await pet.save;
// Way 2
await pet.update({
    name: "Fido, Sr."
});
```


### Deleting a single item {#9824 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="9824"}
 
```
 {#4bc5 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="4bc5"}
// Find the pet with id = 1
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
// Notice this is an instance method
pet.destroy();
```


### Deleting multiple items {#dc1a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="dc1a"}
 
```
 {#d000 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="d000"}
// Notice this is a static class method
await Pet.destroy({
    where: {
        petTypeId: 1 // Destorys all the pets where the petType is 1
    }
});
```


### Query Format {#d21c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="d21c"}

### findOne {#dcdd .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--h3 name="dcdd"}

```
 {#8651 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="8651"}
await <Model>.findOne({
    where: {
        <column>: {
            [Op.<operator>]: <value>
        }
    },
});
```


### findAll {#fe40 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="fe40"}

```
 {#2ea7 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="2ea7"}
await <Model>.findAll({
    where: {
        <column>: {
            [Op.<operator>]: <value>
        }
    },
    include: <include_specifier>,
    offset: 10,
    limit: 2
});
```


### findByPk {#c112 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="c112"}

```
 {#a4f2 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="a4f2"}
await <Model>.findByPk(<primary_key>, {
    include: <include_specifier>
});
```


### Eager loading associations with `include` {#d570 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="d570"}
 
Simple include of one related model.

```
 {#1379 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="1379"}
await Pet.findByPk(1,  {
        include: PetType
    })
```


Include can take an array of models if you need to include more than
one.

```
 {#ca89 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="ca89"}
await Pet.findByPk(1, {
        include: [Pet, Owner]
    })
```


Include can also take an object with keys `model`  and `include`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}.\
This is in case you have nested associations.\
In this case Owner doesn\'t have an association with PetType, but\
Pet does, so we want to include PetType onto the Pet Model.

```
 {#e81d .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="e81d"}
await Owner.findByPk(1, {
        include: {
            model: Pet
            include: PetType
        }
    });
```


### toJSON method {#2a72 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="2a72"}

The confusingly named toJSON() method does **not** return a JSON string
but instead\
returns a POJO for the instance.

```
 {#40f4 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="40f4"}
// pet is an instance of the Pet class
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
console.log(pet) // prints a giant object with
                 // tons of properties and methods
// petPOJO is now just a plain old Javascript Object
const petPOJO = pet.toJSON();
console.log(petPOJO); // { name: "Fido", petTypeId: 1 }
```


### Common Where Operators {#7313 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="7313"}

```
 {#a55b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--h3 name="a55b"}
const Op = Sequelize.Op
[Op.and]: [{a: 5}, {b: 6}] // (a = 5) AND (b = 6)
[Op.or]: [{a: 5}, {a: 6}]  // (a = 5 OR a = 6)
[Op.gt]: 6,                // > 6
[Op.gte]: 6,               // >= 6
[Op.lt]: 10,               // < 10
[Op.lte]: 10,              // <= 10
[Op.ne]: 20,               // != 20
[Op.eq]: 3,                // = 3
[Op.is]: null              // IS NULL
[Op.not]: true,            // IS NOT TRUE
[Op.between]: [6, 10],     // BETWEEN 6 AND 10
[Op.notBetween]: [11, 15], // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15
[Op.in]: [1, 2],           // IN [1, 2]
[Op.notIn]: [1, 2],        // NOT IN [1, 2]
[Op.like]: '%hat',         // LIKE '%hat'
[Op.notLike]: '%hat'       // NOT LIKE '%hat'
[Op.iLike]: '%hat'         // ILIKE '%hat' (case insensitive) (PG only)
[Op.notILike]: '%hat'      // NOT ILIKE '%hat'  (PG only)
[Op.startsWith]: 'hat'     // LIKE 'hat%'
[Op.endsWith]: 'hat'       // LIKE '%hat'
[Op.substring]: 'hat'      // LIKE '%hat%'
[Op.regexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // REGEXP/~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
[Op.notRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // NOT REGEXP/!~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
[Op.iRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // ~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
[Op.notIRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // !~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
[Op.like]: { [Op.any]: ['cat', 'hat']}
```

### Accessing the Data {#4ae1 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--figure name="4ae1"}

You can access an  query the data using the `findByPk` , `findOne`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}, and
 hods. First, make sure you
import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming
your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models
folder.

```
 {#3c05 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="3c05"}
const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require('./models');
```


The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We
have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to
access each table individually. The associations that you have defined
in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables
when you query your database using the `include`  option.

If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the
`findAll`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} method. You need to await this,
so make sure your function is async.

```
 {#b15b .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="b15b"}
async function findAllRecipes() {
```


```
 {#6e3f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="6e3f"}
return await Recipe.findAll();
```


```
 {#1323 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="1323"}
}
```


If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a
shopping list for all the recipes, you would use `include` . This is possible because of the association you have
defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.

```
 {#9ce7 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="9ce7"}
async function getShoppingList() {
```


```
 {#4a27 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="4a27"}
return await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });
```


```
 {#a2bd .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="a2bd"}
}
```


If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients
list, you would use `findOne`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} and
`findByPk`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}.

```
 {#dd10 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="dd10"}
async function findAChickenRecipe() {
```


```
 {#5542 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="5542"}
const chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({
```


```
 {#e927 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="e927"}
where: {
```


```
 {#fb44 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="fb44"}
foodStuff: 'chicken'
```


```
 {#4057 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="4057"}
}
```


```
 {#71cb .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="71cb"}
});
```


```
 {#091c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="091c"}
return await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);
```


```
 {#0b95 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="0b95"}
}
```


### Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows {#db2a .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--pre name="db2a"}

You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you
are saving one record into the table). You can
either `.build`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} the row and
then `.save`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} it, or you
can `.create`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} it. Either way it does the
same thing. Here are some examples:

Let's  ay we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for
simp icity). When we get the results of the form, we can:
 
```
 {#537f .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="537f"}
const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });
```


```
 {#1336 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="1336"}
await newRecipe.save();
```


This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You
can do the same thing like this:

```
 {#b78e .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="b78e"}
await Recipe.create({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });
```


If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use
`update`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}. Let\'s say we want to change
the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle soup with extra veggies, first
we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.

```
 {#0071 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="0071"}
const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' } });
```


```
 {#ced6 .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="ced6"}
await modRecipe.update({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' });
```


To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process.
Find the recipe you want to delete and `destroy`  it, like this:

```
 {#ee9a .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--p name="ee9a"}
const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' } });
```


```
 {#c98c .graf .graf--pre .graf-after--pre name="c98c"}
await deleteThis.destroy();
```


**NOTE:** If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you
will need to use `.then`{.markup--code .markup--p-code}
and `.catch`{.markup--code .markup--p-code} to do more with the items
you are accessing and modifying.

### Documentation {#219c .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="219c"}

For the data typ s and validations in your models, here are the official
doc . The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific
sections with just the lists:\
**Sequelize Data Types:**
[*https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html*](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html) \
**Validations:**
[*https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html\#validations*](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations) \
When you access the data in your queries, here are the operators
available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the
specific section with the list of operators.\
**Operators:**
[*https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html\#operators*](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators) \
The documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and
destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my
opinion, it just has a title that we have not been using in this course.
When they talk about an instance, they mean an item stored in your
table.\
**Create/Update/Destroy:**
[*https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html*](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html)
